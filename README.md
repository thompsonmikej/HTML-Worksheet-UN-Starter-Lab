# HTML-Worksheet-UN-Starter-Lab

**Developed at devCodeCamp**

A practical exercise designed to teach and reinforce the use of semantic HTML. Built and examined a well-structured HTML document, and gained hands-on experience with best practices for web page structure and accessibility.

## Description

This lab guided me through the creation and analysis of a semantic HTML document. By toggling between a live browser view and editing the source in VS Code, became familiarized with modern HTML5 elements, their proper usage, and the rationale behind semantic markup. Used minimal styling to keep focus upon document structure and semantic meaning over appearance.

---

## Features

- Practice with semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.)
- Emphasis on accessibility and readable document structure
- Content-driven: focuses on what can be achieved with pure HTML, no CSS
- Interactive: encourages switching between browser and code editor to reinforce learning

## Technologies Used

- HTML5

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/thompsonmikej/HTML-Worksheet-UN-Starter-Lab.git
    cd HTML-Worksheet-UN-Starter-Lab
    ```

2. **Open the project:**
    - Double-click on `index.html` to view in your browser
    - Open the project folder in VS Code or your favorite code editor

---

## Usage

- Follow instructions in the browser to walk through each section and complete coding tasks as prompted.
- Refer to the HTML source code for examples and for adding your own semantic elements.
- Use the finished document as a reference for future web projects.

---

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

- Learned the importance of semantic elements for accessible, maintainable web pages
- Gained practical experience structuring HTML without relying on CSS
- Understood how clean markup aids both developers and assistive technologies

---

## Future Improvements

- Add sections on ARIA roles and further accessibility best practices
- Include extension activities, like converting the worksheet to include additional interactive elements using JavaScript
- Compare semantic structure with non-semantic approaches for deeper learning
